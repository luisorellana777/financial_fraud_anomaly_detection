## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand transaction patterns and identify trends.
- Data preprocessing to handle missing data, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
- Implementation of anomaly detection algorithms including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine
- Evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness of fraud detection.
- Visualizations to interpret results and gain insights.


## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of anonymized financial transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

- Source: [A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection](https://www.msc-les.org/proceedings/emss/2016/EMSS2016_249.pdf)
- Structure:
  - Features represent transaction details (e.g., amount, time, frequency).
  - Labels indicate whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Preprocessing Steps:

- Handled missing or inconsistent values.
- Scaled numerical features for model compatibility.
- Addressed data imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.


## Usage
Chose between [FastAPI Integration](https://github.com/luisorellana777/financial_fraud_anomaly_detection/blob/master/anomaly-detection/src/main/resources/model/load_model_FastAPI.py), or [Python Script Integration](https://github.com/luisorellana777/financial_fraud_anomaly_detection/blob/master/anomaly-detection/src/main/resources/model/load_model_command_line.py) through this [property](https://github.com/luisorellana777/financial_fraud_anomaly_detection/blob/master/anomaly-detection/src/main/resources/application.yml#L8).


Run in [Spring Boot service folder](https://github.com/luisorellana777/financial_fraud_anomaly_detection/tree/master/anomaly-detection):
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```


## Models and Techniques
This project uses the following algorithms for anomaly detection:

Logistic Regression: Detects anomalies by hyperplane of separation.
Support Vector Machine: Identifies patterns using support vector methods.

These methods are suitable for imbalanced datasets and require explicit labels for fraud cases.

The results of the project are summarized below:

Performance Metrics:

- Precision: 79%
- Recall: 60%
- F1-Score: 62%
